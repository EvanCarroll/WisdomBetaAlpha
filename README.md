FAQ?
====

* Is it production ready? Probably, but maybe not.
* Beta and alpha? Yes. Beta and Alpha. This release is both Beta and Alpha. Prove me wrong. I'm releasing the software and I get to define the terms. It's fucking Beta and Alpha. And Omega, and Phi. And it only runs on terminals connected to the Web 2.0 running on the Information Superhighway.
